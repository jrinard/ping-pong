# _Ping Pong_


#### By _**Joshua Rinard**_

## Description

This site demonstrates arrays and loops. The objective was to allow the user to input a number and that number would be displayed from 1 to that number. Then along the way if the numbers were divisible by 3, 5, or 15 it displays the words ping, pong or ping-pong instead of that value.

## Specs

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
   in: 3
   out: ping

* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
    in: 5
    out: pong

* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"
    in: 15
    out: ping-pong

## Execution

_Specifically with Scripts_

1 Brainstorm ideas of what you may need.
        An array to store values, For loop to get all values in between

2 Establish a function to do the work
    a. Inside you will need a loop to determine if the number needs to be swapped for a word
        I. divisible by 3 will be changed into ping
        II. divisible by 5 will be changed into pong
        III. divisible by 15 will be changed into ping-pong
        IV. If the value is not divisible then just input the same value into the array
      Results will be pushed into an array

3 Create a second loop to run through your array and push li tags to help with display.

4 Establish user interface logic
      Call the main function with placing the input into it. Assign it to a variable.
      Call the final variable and show it on the interface
